# Real-time-facemask-detection - Data Mining Project

Files : Gui.py
	trainModel.py
	DetectVideo.py
	
Please update the dataset folder location in the line 21 of 
trainModel.py and run it. It takes around 45 mins to an hour 
for training.
Once training is complete run the DetectVideo.py file.

Alternatively Gui.py can be used to run the training and detection 
scripts in that order.
